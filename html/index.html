                Paul Amusan is a young, energetic, and talented fashion designer who focuses on his men’s 
                clothing line, Paul Amusan. His work draws inspiration from local Nigerian fabrics coupled 
                with Japanese tailoring designs. His designs are masculine, yet modern and trendy by way of
                 transforming an ordinary look into a sophisticated design that embraces elegance.

                I began acquired his love for fashion when he was a young boy where he spent his time
                 sketching and drawing. He loves to work with colors, and his awesome talent has seen his pieces worn by famous politicians and celebrities. Young and successful, he is a talented fashion designer to watch out for as his name continues to cause ripples in both the local and global fashion industries.
                
                While in New York, I was employed in the Charivari Boutique where president of the
                 company, Barbara Weiser, noticed my potential and passion for unique fashion and helped me launch my first fashion collection. My passion for African fashion is profound. “Everything begins for me with the print and fabric, which usually has some shine,” exclaims Faturoti. My deep African roots, as well as extensive global experience with having lived and worked in New York and Milan have been instrumental in her success and international spotlight.
                
                My pieces are also sold globally in the UK, US, and France. Anthony uses his talent to 
                make an impact on the community through a mentoring program he runs that helps young 
                and upcoming Nigerian designers excel and compete on a global platform. Nature, colors,
                 and artwork are his main sources of inspiration.
